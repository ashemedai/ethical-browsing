# Ethical Browsing

## Introduction

Ethical Browsing hosts some uBlock Origin filters I created to filter out
search engine results that I consider unethical.

Under unethical I consider sites that abuse SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
in order to get their sites higher in search engine results to drive traffic to
claim that sweet, sweet ad revenue. This also includes sites that exploit their
writers, use generative AI to write their stories, or otherwise are a detriment
to humanity at large by wasting our collective time.

All of this should, hopefully, lead to an overall better signal-to-noise ratio
for search engine results.
