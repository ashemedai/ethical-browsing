# Ethical Browsing

## Introduction

Ethical Browsing is a repository hosting some uBlock Origin filters I created
to filter out results in my used search engines that I consider unethical.

Under unethical I consider sites that abuse SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
in order to get their sites higher in search engine results to drive traffic.
This also includes sites that exploit their writers, use generative AI to write
their stories, or otherwise are a detriment to humanity at large by wasting our
collective time.
